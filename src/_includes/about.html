            As a curious youth, I loved building things, exploring the edge, and understanding how cool stuff worked;
            This
            curiosity has become the driver and foundation of my career.

            As a computational thinker, I seek to collaboratively build systems and products that help physicians and
            scientists advance personalized medicine and combat genetic disease. I am fascinated and inspired by the
            integration of computer science, biology, engineering, and bioinformatics to predict
            how biological systems change over time so as to develop solutions to advance our understanding of human
            health.

            When I‚Äôm not focusing on software, I enjoy contemplative walking in good weather, coffee shops,
            and going on
            adventures with my wife!
